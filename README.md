I have added some of my coding projects to this GitHub repo for you to view. I have added all of them to this repo in a compressed zip file.
To view the code, click on the project you wish to view and then click View Raw. This will download the project to your computer. 
When you open up the zipped folder in File Explorer, make sure you extract all files before viewing the project. 
Thanks and enjoy the projects I made!
